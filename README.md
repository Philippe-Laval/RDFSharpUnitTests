UnitTests for RDFSharp

I have created several files (SparqlQueryTests.cs) where I try to reproduce Sparql queries from 
-  https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/
- https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/ 
with RDFSharp library.

This is a good way to learn RDFSharp library and what is possible to do with Sparql.
